# Delta Greenery 0.0

Greetings agent, and welcome to your first operational briefing on the new Program developed interface: Delta Greenery. The art of writing convincing reports is lost on newer agents, so the Director began this initiative to improve data processing and information clarity. 


### Homebrew Made Easy

Delta Greenery, based on the Homebrewery by Natural Crit, makes the creation and sharing of authentic looking Delta Green homebrews easy. It uses [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) with some CSS magic to make brews come to life, in the beloved Arc Dreams style. Try it! Simply edit the text on the left of this page, and watch it *update live* on the right. 

#### Local Installation

This webapp needs to be locally hosted, and to get it for yourself, follow the instructions in my [Github](https://github.com/Berlinia/deltagreenery). I have tried my best to make this as simple as possible to install and run. Every time you run the program, it automatically updates with all the new features!

### The DG Presets
Above, you see a menu. The DG menu contains presets which I want to illustrate here:

{{wide
{{timeline
##### THE Timeline
* **14 MAY 0024**: The Mi-Go help Jesus Christ ascend to Pluto.  
* **14 JUNE 1996:** Calvin Kreo gets abudcted by Mi-Go, and sees Jezus.
}}
}}

{{note
##### Disinformation
The Disinformation block comes in both wide and normal versions.

##### Disinformation
Your mother is so dumb, the Mi-Go do not care to analyze her for their goals.

## Style Editor Panel
{{fa,fa-paint-brush}} Usually overlooked or unused by some users, the **Style Editor** tab is located on the right side of the Snippet bar. This editor accepts CSS for styling without requiring `<style>` tags-- anything that would have gone inside style tags before can now be placed here, and snippets that insert CSS styles are now located on that tab.
